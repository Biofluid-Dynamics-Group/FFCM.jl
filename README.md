Julia implementation of the Fast Force-Coupling Method (FFCM) ([Su & Keaveny (2024), *Accelerating the
force-coupling method for hydrodynamic interactions in periodic
domains*, J. Comput. Phys. **510**, 113060](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999124003097)), for
hydrodynamic interactions between rigid spheres in a triply-periodic
Stokes flow.

FFCM is a numerical approximation to the mobility tensor of a collection of identical spherical rigid particles
suspended in a fluid that obeys the Stokes equation with periodic boundary conditions. Given $N$ spherical particles of radius $a=1$ located at $\left(\boldsymbol{Y}_n\right) _{n = 1}^N \subset \Omega$
with forces $\left(\boldsymbol{F}_n\right) _{n = 1}^N$ acting on them, where $\Omega \cong \mathbb{T}^3$, FFCM computes
their resulting velocities $\left(\boldsymbol{V}_n\right) _{n = 1}^N$ considering hydrodynamic interactions.

This package currently _only_ implements the linear force-velocity relationship for each sphere.

## Installation

FFCM is registered in the Julia General registry: from the Julia REPL, enter
package mode with `]` and run

```julia-repl
pkg> add FFCM
```

## Usage

The package provides three objects for plug-and-play usage of the method. `FFCMConfig` provides
the setup for the problem, where the physics (domain size, number of particles, viscosity) and
numerical parameters (spectral method grid, local stencil size, method parameters) can be set.

`FFCMMobility` is the actual mobility operator, and `mobility!` is a mutating function that acts on its first argument, populating it with the
velocities given by the arguments (both interfaces share the same backend).

```julia
using FFCM

T = Float32  # or Float64

L_x = T(10)  # Set \Omega = [0, 10)^3
L_y = T(10)
L_z = T(10)

μ = T(1)  # Viscosity

R_c = T(1)  # Cutoff radius
kernel_widths_ratio = T(2)  # FFCM splitting parameter

Y = T[9.3 4.1 -0.4 4.0; 4.0 4.2 4.0 9.9; 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0]  # Positions 3xN
F = T[0.5 -0.3 0.2 0.1; -0.1 0.4 0.0 0.3; 0.2 0.1 0.7 -0.5]  # Forces 3xN
N = size(Y, 2)  # Number of particles

num_points = Int32(16)  # Grid discretisation
M_G = 8  # Stencil size

config = FFCMConfig(
    L = (L_x, L_y, L_z),
    R_c = R_c,
    N = N,
    kernel_widths_ratio = kernel_widths_ratio,
    viscosity = μ,
    num_grid_points = (num_points, num_points, num_points),
    M_G = M_G,
)

V = zeros(T, 3, N)  # Target array for velocities, size 3xN of type T
mobility!(V, config, Y, F)  # Use FFCM as a function

M = FFCMMobility(config, Y)  # Mobility operator
V = M * F  # Alternatively, use the method as a linear operator (useful for iterative solvers)
```

The first mobility call after loading the package will trigger compilation, but subsequent calls should run at full speed.

## Parameter optimisation

The method has three parameters:
- $\Sigma/\sigma$ (`kernel_widths_ratio`)
- $R_c$ (`R_c`)
- $M_G$ (`M_G`)

_Helpers to calibrate the method parameters to target hardware are planned and not yet available._

## GPU acceleration

A GPU parallel implementation that follows the paper authors' reference CUDA
implementation, [cuFCM](https://github.com/racksa/cuFCM), is available as a package
extension dependent on [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl).

First, select a GPU by setting a single integer as the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment
variable in your terminal:
```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<index>
```

On Windows, set the same variable in PowerShell (`$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "<index>"`)
or use WSL2 — the GPU backend does not require a Unix shell.

> On one of Imperial College London's Mathematics Deparment NVIDIA clusters, you can check on the
> available cards using 
> ```bash
> gpustat
> ```
> and then pin the `<index>` of whichever NVIDIA card is available to `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

If a single card set in `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and [CUDA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CUDA.jl)
is available in your environment, loading it alongside FFCM and
adding `gpu_acceleration = true` to the config constructor will trigger the parallel algorithm:

```julia
using CUDA
using FFCM

config = FFCMConfig(
    L = (L_x, L_y, L_z),
    R_c = R_c,
    N = N,
    kernel_widths_ratio = kernel_widths_ratio,
    viscosity = μ,
    num_grid_points = (num_points, num_points, num_points),
    M_G = M_G,
    gpu_acceleration = true,
)
```

Everything else is unchanged: `mobility!` and `FFCMMobility` take and return ordinary host
arrays, and the whole pipeline runs resident on the device (the host-device traffic is
handled internally). `Float32` is the intended GPU precision; `Float64` works but emits a
warning, since consumer NVIDIA cards run double precision at a small fraction of
single-precision throughput. For the same inputs, the GPU backend reproduces the CPU
backend's velocities to round-off.
