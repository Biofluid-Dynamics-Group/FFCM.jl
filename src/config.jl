Cell-list bookkeeping for the pairwise correction (paper §4): the per-particle
cell hash, the sort permutation, the per-cell occupancy ranges with the
counting-sort workspace, and the GPU neighbour map. The first five buffers are
integer-indexed.

The storage type `IntVector` is `Vector{Int32}` on the CPU backend and the
device vector type on the GPU backend, so the backend is a type-parameter swap.
`NeighborMap` is the single backend-divergent field: `Nothing` on the CPU (whose
correction computes neighbours on the fly) and the device half-shell map on the
GPU.

# Fields
- `cell_hash::IntVector`: per-particle 0-based linear cell index (length `N`).
- `original_index::IntVector`: sorted slot to original particle index (length `N`).
- `cell_start::IntVector`, `cell_end::IntVector`: 1-based inclusive sorted-slot
  range of each cell (length `prod(num_cells)`).
- `counting_sort_scratch::IntVector`: per-cell counting-sort workspace
  (length `prod(num_cells)`).
- `neighbor_map::NeighborMap`: `nothing` on the CPU; on the GPU the device vector
  of 13 forward half-shell neighbour cells per cell (length `13 * prod(num_cells)`),
  built by `_build_neighbor_map` and consumed by the pairwise correction.

Particle-indexed `3xN` work buffers the cell-list pipeline folds and reorders
the caller's positions and forces into (paper §4), kept distinct from the
integer cell-list bookkeeping in `CellBuffers`.

The storage type `Mat` is `Matrix{T}` on the CPU backend and the device matrix
type on the GPU backend. `Staging` is the backend-divergent type of the
host↔device staging buffers: `Nothing` on the CPU (which consumes the caller's
host arrays directly) and the device matrix type on the GPU, where `mobility!`
uploads the caller's positions/forces into `Y_input`/`F_input` and downloads the
velocities from `V_output`, hiding the host↔device traffic.

# Fields
- `Y_wrapped::Mat`: caller positions folded into the periodic box (so the
  caller's `Y` is never mutated).
- `Y_sorted::Mat`, `F_sorted::Mat`: positions and forces in cell-sorted order.

  device-resident copies of the caller's raw `3xN` positions and forces.

  velocity output, copied back into the caller's `V` after the pipeline.

        fft_planning = :measure, fft_threads = 1, gpu_acceleration = false,
    ) -> FFCMConfig{T}
    FFCMConfig(; L, ...) -> FFCMConfig{eltype(L)}

Configuration of the Fast FCM mobility operator: the cell partition of the pairwise
correction (paper §4), the FCM grid parameters (paper §3 and §5), and the per-call buffers
sized for `N` particles. Built once and reused across `mobility!` calls, which write into
the buffers this struct owns. `N` is fixed at construction — changing `N` requires a new
`FFCMConfig`.

The compiled buffers are grouped into the `cells`, `particles`, `grid`, `solver`, and
`stencil` sub-structs; their storage types parameterize `FFCMConfig`, so selecting the GPU
backend is a type swap and the backend never appears on the `mobility!` hot path.

The type-parameter-free form infers the working precision `T` from the element type of
the domain lengths `L`, which must be a concrete subtype of `AbstractFloat`.

# Keywords
- `L::NTuple{3, T}`: the domain lengths `(L_x, L_y, L_z)` (paper §4). Each component must be
  positive.
- `R_c::T`: the cutoff radius of the pairwise correction. Must satisfy
  `0 < R_c ≤ min(L)/2`, so the minimum image is unambiguous and no particle is corrected
  against its own periodic image (paper §4).
- `N::Integer`: the number of particles; fixes the hot-path buffer sizes. Must be positive.
- `a::T = T(1)`: the particle hydrodynamic radius. Only `a == T(1)` is currently supported;
  the kernel width follows `σ = a/√π` (paper §2, the FCM radius-width relation that recovers
  the single-particle Stokes drag).
- `kernel_widths_ratio::T`: the ratio between the wider Gaussian kernel width and the
  standard FCM kernel width (paper §5). Must satisfy `kernel_widths_ratio ≥ T(1)`; ratio of
  1 is the standard FCM limit.
- `num_grid_points::NTuple{3, Int32}`: the FFT grid dimensions `(M_x, M_y, M_z)` (paper §3).
  The induced spacing `h = L_i / M_i` must be identical across axes (paper §3 assumption).
- `M_G::Integer`: the cubic stencil support per axis (paper §5). Stored as `Int32`; must
  satisfy `2 ≤ M_G ≤ min(num_grid_points)` — the stencil cannot be wider than the grid on
  any axis, or the periodic wrap would alias distinct stencil points onto the same grid
  point.
- `viscosity::T`: the fluid dynamic viscosity (paper §2, Stokes momentum balance). Must be
  positive.
- `fft_planning::Symbol = :measure`: the FFT planner effort, one of `:estimate`,
  `:measure`, or `:patient`. The measuring efforts spend construction time (seconds at
  large grids) searching for faster transforms for the repeated `stokes_solve!` calls of
  a long solve; `:estimate` plans instantly from heuristics. The computed velocities are
  independent of the effort to round-off.
- `fft_threads::Integer = 1`: the execution thread count baked into the FFT plans. Must
  be at least 1. Threaded plans execute as Julia tasks, which allocate per call: the
  allocation-free hot path requires `fft_threads = 1`. The computed velocities match the
  single-threaded result to round-off. Ignored by the GPU backend.
- `gpu_acceleration::Bool = false`: build the configuration on a CUDA GPU rather than the
  CPU. Requires the `CUDA` extension to be loaded (`using CUDA`) on a machine with a
  functional CUDA device; otherwise construction throws. `Float64` on the GPU emits a
  non-fatal warning, since double-precision throughput is a fraction of single-precision
  on consumer NVIDIA hardware.

# Returns
- `FFCMConfig{T}`: the configuration `mobility!` operates on.

# Throws
- `ArgumentError`: if `R_c ≤ 0`, any `L_i ≤ 0`, `R_c > min(L)/2`, `N ≤ 0`, `a ≠ T(1)`
  (non-unit radius not yet implemented), `kernel_widths_ratio < 1`, `M_G < 2`,
  `M_G > min(num_grid_points)`, any `num_grid_points` component `< 1`, the grid spacing is
  anisotropic, `viscosity ≤ 0`, `fft_planning` is not one of the three planner efforts,
  `fft_threads < 1`, or `gpu_acceleration = true` without the `CUDA` extension loaded. The
  type-parameter-free form additionally throws if `eltype(L)` is not a concrete subtype of
  `AbstractFloat` (integer or mixed-precision lengths are rejected, not promoted — the
  working precision is an explicit choice).
